	abstract = {Background Advances in our technological capacity to interrogate brain tumour biology has led to the ever-increasing use of genomic sequencing in routine diagnostic decision making. Presently, brain tumours are routinely classified based on their epigenetic signatures, leading to a paradigm shift in diagnostic pathways. Such testing can be performed so rapidly using nanopore sequencing that results can be provided intraoperatively. This information greatly improves upon the fidelity of smear diagnosis and can help surgeons tailor their approach, balancing the risks of surgery with the likely benefit. Nevertheless, full integrated diagnosis may require subsequent additional assays to detect pathognomonic somatic mutations and structural variants, thereby delaying the time to final diagnosis.Methods Here, we present ROBIN, a tool based upon PromethION nanopore sequencing technology that can provide both real-time, intraoperative methylome classification and next-day comprehensive molecular profiling within a single assay. ROBIN uniquely integrates three methylation classifiers 1{\textendash}3 to improve diagnostic performance in the intraoperative setting.Findings We demonstrate classifier performance on 50 prospective intraoperative cases, achieving a diagnostic turnaround time under 2 hours and generating robust tumour classifications within minutes of sequencing. Furthermore, ROBIN can detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs) and structural variants (SVs) in real-time, and is able to inform a complete integrated diagnosis within 24 hours. Classifier performance demonstrated concordance with final integrated diagnosis in 90\% of prospective cases.Interpretation Nanopore sequencing can greatly improve upon the turnaround times for standard of care diagnostic testing, including sequencing, and is furthermore able to reliably provide clinically actionable intraoperative tumour classification.Funding The Jean-Shanks Foundation, the Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland, the British Neuropathological Society, and the Wellcome Trust.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe Jean-Shanks Foundation, the Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland, the British Neuropathological Society, and the Wellcome Trust.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The National Research Ethics Committee of the East Midlands gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

However until recently nanopore sequencing has been mainly applied to small genomes, due to the limited output attainable. We present nanopore sequencing and assembly of the GM12878 Utah/Ceph human reference genome generated using the Oxford Nanopore MinION and R9.4 version chemistry. We generated 91.2 Gb of sequence data (~30x theoretical coverage) from 39 flowcells. De novo assembly yielded a highly complete and contiguous assembly (NG50 ~3Mb). We observed considerable variability in homopolymeric tract resolution between different basecallers. The data permitted sensitive detection of both large structural variants and epigenetic modifications. Further we developed a new approach exploiting the long-read capability of this system and found that adding an additional 5x-coverage of "ultra-long" reads (read N50 of 99.7kb) more than doubled the assembly contiguity. Modelling the repeat structure of the human genome predicts extraordinarily contiguous assemblies may be possible using nanopore reads alone. Portable de novo sequencing of human genomes may be important for rapid point-of-care diagnosis of rare genetic diseases and cancer, and monitoring of cancer progression.
